# BBSC
We present the scripts used to preprocess and process a deep brain imaging dataset derived from the Bergen Breakfast Scanning Club (BBSC) project. 

The dataset comprises data collected from three subjects who underwent repeated scanning over the course of approximately one year. Specifically, three types of data chunks were collected: behavioral data, functional brain data, and structural brain data. Functional brain images, encompassing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), along with their anatomical reference T1-weighted brain images, were collected twice a week during the data collection period. In total, 38, 40, and 25 sessions of functional data were acquired for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On the other hand, structural brain images, including T2-weighted brain images, diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, were obtained once a month. A total of 10, 9, and 6 sessions were collected for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
